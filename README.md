# Wallboard
## Switch between external websites

This project is an investigation to see how to cycle between a number of external websites. Typically this would display on a wall mounted screen used in a Local Disaster Coordination centre.

Script.JS Defines an array of the target sites;
* https://www.moretonbay.qld.gov.au/maps-disaster.aspx'
* http://www.bom.gov.au/products/IDR503.loop.shtml#skip'

Obviously this data should move to config file or similar and have an internace to edit the list. I haven't done that yet!
